## Overview

**Docker Integration Host** is a centralized platform for managing multiple Docker daemons across different hosts. It simplifies container orchestration by providing a unified interface for container lifecycle management, network and volume configuration, live monitoring, image handling, and command execution.

This tool is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and teams working with distributed containerized environments.

### Architecture Components

**Frontend Layer**: React-based user interface with Tailwind CSS for styling, providing an intuitive dashboard for Docker management.

**API Gateway**: Dual-channel communication system with Django REST API for standard operations and WebSocket server for real-time data streaming.

**Backend Services**: Modular service architecture handling specific Docker operations:

- Container lifecycle management
- Network configuration
- Volume management
- Image handling
- Resource monitoring
- Log streaming

**Docker Hosts**: Multiple remote Docker daemons managed through the centralized interface.

pip install -r requirements.txt
daphne home.asgi:application
```

### ⚛️ Frontend Setup (React + Tailwind + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 🔐 Authentication and Dashboard

After successful login, you'll access the **Dashboard** displaying all connected Docker hosts. Use **Create Host** to add new Docker daemon connections.

### 🖥️ Host Management

Select any connected host to access its management interface with four main sections:

#### 🐳 Containers Section

- View all existing containers
- Create new containers using the **Create Container** button
- Access individual container management:
  - View details and metadata
  - Monitor live logs
  - Track CPU, memory, and network statistics
  - Control container lifecycle (start, stop, restart, delete)
  - Execute terminal commands
  - Manage network attachments
  - Configure volume bindings

#### 📂 Volumes Section

- Browse available volumes
- Create new volumes
- Delete existing volumes

#### 🌐 Networks Section

- List and manage Docker networks
- Create custom networks
- Delete networks
- Manage container network attachments

#### 🖼️ Images Section

- Browse Docker images on the host
- Pull images from registries
- Delete unused images
- Build custom images
